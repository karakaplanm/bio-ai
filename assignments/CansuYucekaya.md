## ABSTRACT 📝
The cell cycle is a fundamental biological process that governs cell growth, DNA replication, and mitosis.  
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have improved the analysis of cell cycle dynamics by enabling:
- Automated classification of phases ⚡
- Detection of mitotic events 🔬
- Interpretation of large-scale imaging or flow cytometry datasets 🖼️

This paper explores AI techniques in cell cycle analysis, discusses current challenges, and highlights future opportunities.

## INTRODUCTION 🧬
The eukaryotic cell cycle consists of four major phases: G1, S, G2, and M.  
Disruptions can lead to uncontrolled cell growth (cancer).  

### Cell Cycle Phases:
- G1 Phase 🟢: Cell growth
- S Phase 🟡: DNA replication
- G2 Phase 🔵: Preparation for mitosis
- M Phase 🟥: Mitosis

AI, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), helps automate the analysis and detect subtle patterns humans may miss.
