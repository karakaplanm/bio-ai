📌 Project Overview

Proteins vary widely in their solubility depending on properties such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and charge. Understanding and predicting solubility is valuable in:

Recombinant protein expression

Drug design and biotechnology

Industrial enzyme production

Protein engineering studies

This project uses a Linear Regression model to learn how these features relate to solubility levels.
