## 3. Machine Learning in Bioinformatics

### 3.1 Supervised Learning

Used for **classification** and **prediction** tasks.

**Examples:**
- Predicting disease risk from gene expression  
- Identifying protein function  

**Common algorithms:**
- Decision Trees
   A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into branches based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node corresponds to a final prediction or class label. The model recursively partitions the dataset using criteria such as Gini impurity, information gain, or mean squared error, depending on whether the task is classification or regression. One of the main advantages of decision trees is their interpretability—users can easily visualize and understand how decisions are made. However, they can be prone to overfitting if not properly pruned or regularized, which is why ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees are often used to improve performance and generalization.
- Random Forest
   A Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds upon the concept of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by constructing a large number of individual decision trees during training, each using a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by aggregating the outputs of all the trees—through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression. This randomness in both data sampling (via bootstrapping) and feature selection ensures that the trees are diverse, making the model more robust and less sensitive to noise in the dataset. Random Forests are widely used because they offer high predictive performance, handle large datasets with many features efficiently, and provide insights into feature importance, all while maintaining good generalization across various types of data.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks, though they are most commonly applied to classification. The key idea behind SVMs is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes with the maximum possible margin. Data points that lie closest to this decision boundary are called support vectors, and they play a crucial role in defining the hyperplane. SVMs can handle linearly separable data using a simple linear boundary, but they can also model complex, non-linear relationships by employing kernel functions such as the radial basis function (RBF) or polynomial kernels. This flexibility allows SVMs to perform well even in high-dimensional spaces. Despite being computationally intensive for large datasets, SVMs are valued for their robustness, effectiveness in small- to medium-sized datasets, and strong theoretical foundation in statistical learning theory.
- Deep Neural Networks
   Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where each layer transforms its input into a higher-level representation. These networks can learn complex, non-linear patterns in data by adjusting the weights of connections through a process called backpropagation, typically optimized using gradient descent. The “deep” aspect refers to having many hidden layers, which enable the model to capture intricate features such as edges in images or linguistic patterns in text. DNNs have been the driving force behind modern deep learning applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Although they require large amounts of data and computational power, their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations makes them one of the most powerful tools in artificial intelligence today.

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning

Used for **clustering** and **dimensionality reduction**.  
Helps discover unknown subtypes of diseases.

**Methods:**
- K-means clustering
   K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. The algorithm begins by randomly initializing K cluster centroids, which represent the centers of the clusters. Each data point is then assigned to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric—typically the Euclidean distance. After assignments, the centroids are recalculated as the mean of all points within each cluster, and this process iterates until the centroids stabilize or the changes become minimal. K-means is widely used due to its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness for well-separated, spherical clusters. However, it has some limitations: the number of clusters K must be defined beforehand, it is sensitive to initial centroid placement, and it may perform poorly with non-globular or overlapping data. Despite these drawbacks, K-means remains a fundamental and widely used clustering technique in data mining, pattern recognition, and exploratory data analysis.
- Hierarchical clustering
   Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters rather than assigning data points to a fixed number of groups from the start. It operates in two main approaches: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down). In the agglomerative method, each data point starts as its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are successively merged based on their similarity—often measured using distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distance—until all points belong to a single cluster. The results are typically visualized as a dendrogram, a tree-like diagram that shows how clusters are merged or split at various similarity levels. Hierarchical clustering is advantageous because it does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance and provides a clear visual representation of relationships between data points. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets and sensitive to the choice of linkage criteria, such as single, complete, or average linkage.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis and machine learning to simplify complex datasets while preserving as much variability as possible. It works by transforming the original correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, which are ordered by the amount of variance they capture from the data. The first principal component explains the largest amount of variation, the second captures the next largest (orthogonal to the first), and so on. Mathematically, PCA uses eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data’s covariance matrix to find these new axes of maximum variance. By projecting the data onto a smaller number of principal components, PCA reduces noise, improves computational efficiency, and helps visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. However, because PCA is a linear method, it may not capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.
- Autoencoders  
   Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used primarily for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. Their main goal is to learn an efficient, compressed representation of input data—called the latent space—by training the network to reconstruct its input at the output layer. An autoencoder consists of two main parts: an encoder, which compresses the input into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the original data from this compressed form. During training, the network minimizes the reconstruction error between the input and output, effectively learning the most important features of the data. Autoencoders are widely used in tasks such as image denoising, anomaly detection, and feature extraction. Variants like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend the concept to probabilistic modeling, enabling the generation of new, similar data samples. Despite their power, autoencoders can sometimes overfit or lose interpretability if the latent space is not properly constrained.
**Example:**  
Grouping breast cancer samples by molecular subtype.
