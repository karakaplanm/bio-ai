## 3. Machine Learning in Bioinformatics

### 3.1 Supervised Learning

Used for **classification** and **prediction** tasks.

**Examples:**
- Predicting disease risk from gene expression  
- Identifying protein function  

**Common algorithms:**
- Decision Trees
   A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into branches based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node corresponds to a final prediction or class label. The model recursively partitions the dataset using criteria such as Gini impurity, information gain, or mean squared error, depending on whether the task is classification or regression. One of the main advantages of decision trees is their interpretability—users can easily visualize and understand how decisions are made. However, they can be prone to overfitting if not properly pruned or regularized, which is why ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosted Trees are often used to improve performance and generalization.
- Random Forest
   A Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds upon the concept of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by constructing a large number of individual decision trees during training, each using a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by aggregating the outputs of all the trees—through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression. This randomness in both data sampling (via bootstrapping) and feature selection ensures that the trees are diverse, making the model more robust and less sensitive to noise in the dataset. Random Forests are widely used because they offer high predictive performance, handle large datasets with many features efficiently, and provide insights into feature importance, all while maintaining good generalization across various types of data.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks, though they are most commonly applied to classification. The key idea behind SVMs is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes with the maximum possible margin. Data points that lie closest to this decision boundary are called support vectors, and they play a crucial role in defining the hyperplane. SVMs can handle linearly separable data using a simple linear boundary, but they can also model complex, non-linear relationships by employing kernel functions such as the radial basis function (RBF) or polynomial kernels. This flexibility allows SVMs to perform well even in high-dimensional spaces. Despite being computationally intensive for large datasets, SVMs are valued for their robustness, effectiveness in small- to medium-sized datasets, and strong theoretical foundation in statistical learning theory.
- Deep Neural Networks
   Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where each layer transforms its input into a higher-level representation. These networks can learn complex, non-linear patterns in data by adjusting the weights of connections through a process called backpropagation, typically optimized using gradient descent. The “deep” aspect refers to having many hidden layers, which enable the model to capture intricate features such as edges in images or linguistic patterns in text. DNNs have been the driving force behind modern deep learning applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Although they require large amounts of data and computational power, their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations makes them one of the most powerful tools in artificial intelligence today.
