## 1. Introduction

**Definition:**  
Bioinformatics combines **biology**, **computer science**, and **statistics** to analyze biological data.  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhances bioinformatics by automating data analysis, discovering hidden patterns, and predicting biological functions.

**Motivation:**
- Explosion of genomic and proteomic data (e.g., Human Genome Project).  
- AI helps interpret this data efficiently.  
- Enables *personalized medicine*, *drug discovery*, and *disease prediction*.

> **Key Question:** How can machines learn from biological data?
