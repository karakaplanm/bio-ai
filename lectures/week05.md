## 1. Introduction to Genomic Data

### 1.1. What is Genomic Data?
Genomic data refers to the **complete set of DNA sequences** within an organism, including all genes and non-coding regions.  
It enables the understanding of biological function, variation, and disease mechanisms.

### 1.2. Major Data Types

| Type | Description | Common File Formats |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **DNA Sequence** | Nucleotides (A, T, G, C) | `.fasta`, `.fastq` |
| **RNA-seq** | Gene expression data | `.bam`, `.sam`, `.gtf` |
| **Variants** | SNPs, INDELs, CNVs | `.vcf`, `.bcf` |
| **Annotations** | Gene structure, function | `.gff3`, `.bed` |

### 1.3. Sources of Genomic Data
- **NCBI GenBank:** Reference genome sequences  
- **Ensembl:** Annotated genome databases  
- **1000 Genomes Project:** Human population variation data  
- **GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus):** Transcriptomic datasets

## 2. Sequence Alignment

Sequence alignment is the process of arranging sequences to identify **regions of similarity** that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.

### 2.1. Types of Alignment

| Type | Description | Example Algorithms |
|------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Global Alignment** | Aligns entire sequences end-to-end | Needlemanâ€“Wunsch |
| **Local Alignment** | Finds most similar subregions | Smithâ€“Waterman |
| **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** | Aligns more than two sequences simultaneously | ClustalW, MUSCLE, MAFFT |

### 2.2. Scoring System
- **Match:** +1  
- **Mismatch:** -1  
- **Gap penalty:** -2  
- **Substitution matrices:**  
  - *PAM* (Point Accepted Mutation)  
  - *BLOSUM* (Blocks Substitution Matrix)

### 2.3. Example: Biopython Alignment
```python
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment

seq1 = "ATGCT"
seq2 = "ATGTT"

alignments = pairwise2.align.globalxx(seq1, seq2)
for a in alignments:
    print(format_alignment(*a))
```

**Output Example:**
```
ATGCT
||| |
ATGTT
Score=4
```

### 2.4. Tools
- **BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool):**  
  Compares a query sequence against a database.
- **Clustal Omega:**  
  Efficient multiple sequence alignment.
- **MAFFT:**  
  Fast MSA for large genomic datasets.

## 3. Classification in Genomics

Classification tasks in genomics often aim to **categorize biological samples** or **predict gene functions** using computational models.

### 3.1. Feature Extraction from Sequences
- **k-mer Analysis:** Count of subsequences of length *k*.  
  Example: For `ATGC`, 2-mers are `AT`, `TG`, `GC`.
- **GC Content:**  
  \[
  GC\% = \frac{G + C}{A + T + G + C} \times 100
  \]
- **Motif Detection:** Searching conserved short patterns in DNA or proteins.
- **One-hot Encoding:** Representing each nucleotide as a binary vector.  
  Example:  
  A = [1,0,0,0], T = [0,1,0,0], G = [0,0,1,0], C = [0,0,0,1]

### 3.2. Machine Learning Models

| Model | Use Case | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Binary gene classification | Fast and interpretable |
| **Random Forest** | Gene expression classification | Handles nonlinear features |
| **SVM** | Promoter vs. non-promoter | Works well with high-dimensional data |
| **Neural Networks (CNN/RNN)** | Sequence-based prediction | Captures local and long-range dependencies |

### 3.3. Example: Gene Expression Classification
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

df = pd.read_csv("gene_expression.csv")
X = df.drop("label", axis=1)
y = df["label"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
```

## 4. Prediction Tasks in Genomic Analysis

Prediction tasks use existing data to **infer unknown biological attributes** such as gene function, regulatory regions, or protein structure.

### 4.1. Gene Function Prediction
- **Homology-based prediction:** Using known gene homologs.  
- **Machine Learning-based:** Predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms.  
- **Deep Learning:** Feature learning directly from sequence input.

### 4.2. Promoter and Enhancer Region Detection
- DNA sequences have specific motifs (e.g., TATA box) indicating regulatory roles.  
- CNN-based architectures are successful at discovering motif patterns.

**CNN-based motif prediction framework:**
```
Input DNA sequence â†’ Convolution layers â†’ Pooling â†’ Dense â†’ Output (Promoter / Non-Promoter)
```

### 4.3. Protein Structure Prediction
- Sequence â†’ Secondary / tertiary structure prediction.  
- **AlphaFold** revolutionized the field using deep learning on sequence co-evolution data.
